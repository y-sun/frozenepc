# Frozen phonon method for electron-phonon coupling calculations

An example of computing screened and unscreened phonon frequency for MgB2 with Phonopy and VASP.

* The simple procedure is in the `run.sh`. You may need to change `.pbs` files so that they can run on your machine. Remember to provide POTCAR for your system.
* Results of MgB2 are provided in the `scr` and `unscr` dictionary as references.
